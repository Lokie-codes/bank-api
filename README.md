## 1. Project Overview

The Banking API Platform revolutionizes financial service integration by offering a unified ecosystem for banks and fintech companies. By standardizing core banking APIs, the platform reduces development time, minimizes integration complexities, and enhances security and scalability.

**Objectives:**
- Standardization through uniform API design following BIAN standards
- Security via API Gateway, OAuth2/JWT authentication, and data encryption
- Scalability using microservices architecture and container orchestration
- Interoperability with third-party services (KYC providers, payment processors)
- Enhanced developer experience with comprehensive documentation and SDKs

## 2. Key Features

- **Customer Onboarding & KYC:** Simplified registration and automated identity verification
- **Payment Processing:** Support for initiating, tracking, and reconciling transactions
- **Account Management:** Access to account details, balances, and transaction history
- **Consent Management:** Capture and manage customer consents for data sharing
- **Secure API Gateway:** Centralized authentication, rate limiting, and request routing
- **Microservices Architecture:** Independent services for each core domain
- **Integration Layer:** Adaptors for external systems including legacy banking platforms
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Real-time observability with centralized logging
- **Compliance:** Built-in support for GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other regulatory frameworks

## 3. Architecture & Technology Stack

### 3.1 System Architecture

The platform uses a layered microservices architecture:

- **Presentation Layer:** Developer Portal and Client Applications
- **API & Security Layer:** Load Balancer and API Gateway with authentication
- **Microservices Layer:**
    - Customer Service
    - KYC Service
    - Payment Service
    - Account Service
    - Consent Management Service
- **Data Layer:** Relational databases, NoSQL, and caching
- **Integration Layer:** Adapters for external systems
- **Monitoring Layer:** Centralized observability tools

### 3.2 Technology Stack

- **API Gateway:** Kong, Apigee, or AWS API Gateway
- **Microservices:** Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, .NET Core
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL/MySQL, MongoDB/Cassandra
- **Containerization:** Docker with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Caching:** Redis or Memcached
- **Messaging:** Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack

## 4. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes cluster or local environment (Minikube)
- Node.js, Java, or .NET Core development environment
- Git for version control

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone htthttps://github.com/Lokie-codes/bank-api.git
cd bank-api

# Build Docker images
docker-compose build

# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Local development
docker-compose up
```

### Configuration

Configuration files in the `config/` directory include API Gateway settings, database connection strings, authentication keys, and environment variables for each microservice.

## 5. API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI:
- Local: http://localhost:8080/docs


## 6. Testing

Our comprehensive testing strategy includes:
- Unit testing for individual functions
- Integration testing between services
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance and security testing

## 7. Deployment & Operations

We implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building, and deployment with monitoring via Prometheus/Grafana and centralized logging with ELK Stack.

## 8. Security

Security measures include:
- OAuth2/JWT authentication at the API Gateway
- TLS/SSL encryption for data in transit
- Encryption for sensitive data at rest
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning

## 9. Contributing
