  - Endpoints to retrieve detailed transaction histories with filtering by date, type, or status.  
  - Support for exporting statements in multiple formats (CSV, PDF).

#### 1.3 Account Management
- **Account Creation & Setup:**  
  - Endpoints to open new accounts, including savings, checking, and specialized accounts.  
  - Integration with core banking systems for real-time account provisioning.
- **Account Information Retrieval:**  
  - APIs to fetch account details such as balances, transaction limits, and account settings.  
  - Dynamic retrieval of account statements and activity logs.
- **Account Updates:**  
  - Endpoints to update account settings, manage linked services, or close accounts.

#### 1.4 Consent Management
- **Consent Capture:**  
  - APIs to capture explicit customer consent for data sharing and third-party integrations.  
  - User interface elements or endpoints to record consent during onboarding.
- **Consent Update & Revocation:**  
  - Endpoints that allow customers to modify or withdraw consent at any time.  
  - Immediate effect of changes across all integrated services.
- **Audit Trail & Reporting:**  
  - Maintain detailed logs of consent actions for regulatory compliance and audit purposes.

#### 1.5 API Standardization & Developer Experience
- **BIAN Standard Implementation:**  
  - Design APIs following BIAN guidelines to ensure consistency and interoperability.  
  - Uniform endpoint structures, naming conventions, and data models.
- **Interactive Documentation:**  
  - Provide comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with sample requests/responses.  
  - Versioned API documentation to manage changes over time.
- **Developer Portal:**  
  - Self-service portal for registration, obtaining API keys, sandbox environments, and community support.  
  - Tutorials, SDKs, and code samples to facilitate quick integration.

#### 1.6 Security & Access Management
- **Secure API Gateway:**  
  - Centralized gateway enforcing OAuth2, JWT, or other token-based authentication mechanisms.  
  - Routing, rate limiting, and logging of all API calls.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
  - Define and enforce roles/permissions to control access to sensitive endpoints.  
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support for administrative and sensitive operations.
- **Data Protection:**  
  - Ensure all data in transit is encrypted (TLS/SSL) and sensitive data is stored securely.  
  - Implement measures for intrusion detection and prevention.

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.1 Performance
- **Low Latency:**  
  - API responses should be optimized for speed, targeting sub-200ms response times for most endpoints.
- **High Throughput:**  
  - Design to handle thousands of concurrent transactions per minute, especially for payment processing.
- **Real-Time Processing:**  
  - Support near real-time updates for transaction statuses and account changes.

#### 2.2 Scalability
- **Horizontal Scalability:**  
  - Architect the platform using microservices that can scale independently as demand increases.
- **Auto-Scaling Capabilities:**  
  - Leverage cloud auto-scaling features to dynamically adjust resource allocation.
- **Load Balancing:**  
  - Use load balancers to evenly distribute incoming requests across multiple service instances.

#### 2.3 Availability & Reliability
- **High Availability:**  
  - Aim for an uptime target of at least 99.99% with redundant components and failover strategies.
- **Fault Tolerance:**  
  - Implement redundancy in both application and data layers to ensure continuity during failures.
- **Disaster Recovery:**  
  - Regularly back up data and maintain a documented disaster recovery plan.

#### 2.4 Security & Compliance
- **Regulatory Compliance:**  
  - Ensure the platform meets relevant standards such as GDPR, PCI-DSS, and local banking regulations.
- **Security Audits & Penetration Testing:**  
  - Regularly conduct security assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Data Privacy:**  
  - Strict controls on access to sensitive data with robust encryption and anonymization where appropriate.
- **Audit Trails:**  
  - Detailed logging of all user actions and system events for regulatory audits and forensic investigations.

#### 2.5 Interoperability & Integration
- **Standard Data Formats:**  
  - Support for common data formats (JSON, XML) with built-in format conversion capabilities.
- **Third-Party Integration:**  
  - Seamless integration with external systems such as legacy banking platforms and third-party service providers.
- **API Gateway Consistency:**  
  - Ensure that the API Gateway uniformly routes and manages all incoming and outgoing requests.

#### 2.6 Maintainability & Extensibility
